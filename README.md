# Neighbourhood-Hack

## Inspiration

Trivial Chat is a website that was created to connect people in the same community/neighborhood together. Today, with covid-19 and lockdown restriction, people have become isolated and this can lead to depression and other mental illnesses. Therefore, as a team, we decided to create a platform where people in the same community will be able to communicate and also avail other financial and informative features at the same time.

## What it does

Trivial Chat allows users to chat with any user in the community using an **embedded chat feature**. Moreover, the site also has a news page that displays all the **latest news** and events that are happening within the neighborhood.
Next, we have the **Covid-19** page, where users with covid-19 in the community are listed, so that people in the neighbourhood know about who is infected within the community in order to reduce the spread of the virus inside the area. Users with the virus will also be able to ask for favours from within the site as they are not able to leave their houses.
Additionally, it strengthens the users financially by providing a platform to be able to find **jobs** and also recruit others.
Last but not least, we have the facilities page, and this displays all the **local businesses/facilities** that are in the community, that residents can use.
